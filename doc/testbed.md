# verified testbed

Our software supports GPUs with the following compute capabilities:
- Pascal; `sm_60`, `sm_61`
- Volta; `sm_70`
- Turing; `sm_75`
- Ampere; `sm_80`, `sm_86`

The toolchain combination is non-exhaustible. We listed our experienced testbed below. Number in GPU-(GCC,CUDA) combination denotes major version of compiler ever tested.
