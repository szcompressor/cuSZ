cuSZ: CUDA-Based Error-Bounded Lossy Compressor for Scientific Data
---

cuSZ is a CUDA implementation of the world-widely used [SZ lossy compressor](https://github.com/szcompressor/SZ). It is the first error-bounded lossy compressor on GPUs for scientific data, which significantly improves SZ's throughput in GPU-based heterogeneous HPC systems. 

This document simply introduces how to install and use the cuSZ compressor on NVIDIA GPUs. More details can be found in [doc/cusz-doc.pdf](https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ/blob/master/doc/cusz-doc.pdf) [in progress].

Our published paper covers the essential design and implementation, accessible via [ACM DL (open access)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3410463.3414624) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09625).

## from GitHub
```bash
git clone git@github.com:szcompressor/cuSZ.git cusz
cd cusz && export CUSZ_ROOT=$(pwd)
make   # can use ${CUSZ_ROOT}/bin/cusz to execute
sudo make install  # requires elevated permission
```
## from Spack

Spack is a multi-platform package manager dedicated for HPC deployment, and it's non-destructive. Currently, deployment of cuSZ requies a workaround on many HPC cluster, see details in [here](./doc/spack-install.md).

# use
## basic use

Type `cusz` or `cusz -h` for instant instructions. Also, a basic use cuSZ is given below.

```bash
./bin/cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1.0e-4.0 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z
             |  ------ ----------- ---------------------------- -------  |
           dtype mode  error bound           input datum          demo   zip

./bin/cusz -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x
           -------------------------------  |
                     sz archive            unzip
```
`-D cesm` specifies preset dataset for demonstration. In this case, it is CESM-ATM, whose dimension is 1800-by-3600, following y-x order. To otherwise specify datum file and input dimensions arbitrarily, we use `-2 3600 1800`, then it becomes

```bash
cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -2 3600 1800 -z
```
To conduct compression, several input arguments are **necessary**,

- `-z` or `--zip` to compress
- `-x` or `--unzip` to decompress
- `-m` or `--mode` to specify compression mode. Options include `abs` (absolute value) and `r2r` (relative to value range)
- `-e` or `--eb` to specify error bound
- `-i` to specify input datum file
- `-D` to specify demo dataset name or `-{1,2,3}` to input dimensions
- `--opath` to specify output path for both compression and decompresson
- `-V` or `--verbose` to print host and device information

## tuning
There are also internal a) quant. code representation, b) Huffman codeword representation, and c) chunk size for Huffman coding exposed. Each can be specified with argument options.

- `-Q` or `--quant-rep`  to specify bincode/quant. code representation. Options `<8|16|32>` are for `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, respectively. (Manually specifying this may not result in optimal memory footprint.)
- `-H` or `--huffman-rep`  to specify Huffman codeword representation. Options `<32|64>` are for `uint32_t`, `uint64_t`, respectively. (Manually specifying this may not result in optimal memory footprint.)
- `-C` or `--huffman-chunk`  to specify chunk size for Huffman codec. This should be a sufficiently large number in power-of-2 (`[256|512|1024|...]`) and affects Huffman encoding/decoding performance *significantly*.


## with preprocessing
Some application such as EXAFEL preprocesses with binning [^binning] in addition to skipping Huffman codec.

[^binning]: A current binning setting is to downsample a 2-by-2 cell to 1 point.

## disabling modules
For EXAFEL, given binning and `uint8_t` have already resulted in a compression ratio of up to 16, Huffman codec may not be needed in a real-world use scenario, so Huffman codec can be skipped with `--skip huffman`.

Decompression can give a full preview of the whole workflow and writing data of the orignal size to the filesystem is long, so writing decompressed data to filesystem can be skipped with `--skip write.x`. 

A combination of modules can be `--skip huffman,write.x`.

Other module skipping for use scenarios are in development.

## use as an analytical tool

`--dry-run` or `-r` in place of `-z` and/or `-x` enables dry-run mode to get PSNR. This employs the feature of dual-quantization that the decompressed data is guaranteed the same with prequantized data.

# hands-on examples

1. run a 2D CESM demo at 1e-4 relative to value range

	```bash
	# compress
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z
	# decompress, use the datum to compress as basename
	cusz -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x
	# decompress, and compare with the original data
	cusz -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x --origin ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH
	```
2. runa 2D CESM demo with specified output path

	```bash
	mkdir data2 data3
	# output compressed data to `data2`
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z --opath data2
	# output decompressed data to `data3`
	cusz -i ./data2/sample-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x --opath data3
	```
3. run CESM demo with `uint8_t` and 256 quant. bins

	```bash
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -x -d 256 -Q 8
	```
4. in addition to the previous command, if skipping Huffman codec,

	```bash
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -d 256 -Q 8 \
		--skip huffman  # or `-X huffman`
	cusz -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x  # `-d`, `-Q`, `-X` is recorded
	```
5. some application such as EXAFEL preprocesses with binning [^binning] in addition to skipping Huffman codec

	```bash
	** cautious, may not be working as of 0.1.3
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -x \
		-d 256 -Q 8 --pre binning --skip huffman	# or `-p binning`
	```
6. dry-run to get PSNR and to skip real compression or decompression; `-r` also works alternatively to `--dry-run`

	```bash
	# This works equivalently to decompress with `--origin /path/to/origin-datum`
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm --dry-run	# or `-r`
	```

# results
## compression ratio

To calculate compression ratio, please use *size of original data* divided by *size of .sz compressed data*.

## compression throughput

To calculate (de)compression throughput, please follow the below steps to use our bash script [`cuSZ/script/parse_nvprof_log.sh`](./script/parse_nvprof_log.sh):
- use `nvprof --log-file [name_of_logfile.txt]` before `cusz` to dump the performance data when (de)compressing
- use `bash parse_nvprof_log.sh [name_of_logfile.txt]` to filter out the unnecessary performance data
- sum up all the numbers between `++++++++++` to get the overall (de)compression time in us
- use the original data size divided by the (de)compression time to get the overall (de)compression throughput
- A sample outpput from `bash parse_nvprof_log.sh <log file>` on the CESM variable `CLDHGH` (25 MiB) is shown [here](./doc/sample-stat.txt).
- From the [sample](./doc/sample-stat.txt), the compression and decompression times are 733.47 us (w/o c/b) and 1208.19 us, respectively. So, the compression and decompression throughputs are 31.4 GB/s and 20.7 GB/s, respectively.

**Please note that cuSZ's performance might be dropped for a single large input file (e.g., in several Gigabytes) because of current coarse-grained deflating in Huffman codec mentioned in [limitations of this version](https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ#limitations-of-this-version-011).**

## limitations of this version (Nov. 6, 2020)

- For this release, cuSZ only supports 32-bit `float`-type datasets. We will support 64-bit `double`-type datasets in the future release. 
- The current integrated Huffman codec runs with efficient histogramming [1], parallel Huffman codebook building [2], memory-copy style encoding, chunkwise bit deflating, and efficient Huffman decoding using canonical codes [3]. However, the chunkwise bit deflating is not optimal, so we are woking on a faster, finer-grained Huffman codec for the future release. 
- We are working on refactoring to support more predictors, preprocessing methods, and compression modes. More functionalities will be released in the next release.
- Please use `-H 64` for HACC dataset because 32-bit representation is not enough for multiple HACC variables. Using `-H 32` will make cuSZ report an error. We are working on automatically adpating 32- or 64-bit representation for different datasets. 
- You may see a performance degradation when handling large-size dataset, such as 1-GB or 4-GB HACC. We are working on autotuning consistent performance.
- Binning preprocessing is subject to change, and currently not available.
