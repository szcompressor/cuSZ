cuSZ: CUDA-Based Error-Bounded Lossy Compressor for Scientific Data
---

cuSZ is a CUDA implementation of the world-widely used [SZ lossy compressor](https://github.com/szcompressor/SZ). It is the first error-bounded lossy compressor on GPUs for scientific data, which significantly improves SZ's throughput in GPU-based heterogeneous HPC systems. 

This document simply introduces how to install and use the cuSZ compressor on NVIDIA GPUs. More details can be found in [doc/cusz-doc.pdf](https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ/blob/master/doc/cusz-doc.pdf) [in progress].

Our published paper covers the essential design and implementation, accessible via [ACM DL (open access)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3410463.3414624) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09625).

## from GitHub

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:szcompressor/cuSZ.git cusz && cd cusz
chmod 755 ./build.py && ./build.py <target> <optional: build type>
```
- For maximal compatibility, use `./build.py compat`. 
- For optimal compilation, use `./build.py <target> <optional: build type>`. 
  - Target names other than `compat` include `p100`, `v100`, `a100`, `pascal`, `turing`, `ampere`.
  - Build types include `release`, `release-profile`, `debug`.
`build.py` automatically builds `cusz`. `sudo make install` can be used to install to system path.

## from Spack

Spack is a multi-platform package manager dedicated for HPC deployment, and it's non-destructive. Currently, deployment of cuSZ requires a workaround on many HPC cluster, see details in [here](./doc/spack-install.md).

# use
## basic use

Type `cusz` or `cusz -h` for instant instructions. Also, a basic use cuSZ is given below.

```bash
./bin/cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1.0e-4.0 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -2 3600 1800 -z
           ------ ------ ----------- ------------------------ ------------  |
            dtype  mode  error bound      input datum file    low-to-high  zip

./bin/cusz -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x
           ---------------------------  |
                     sz archive        unzip
```
`-D cesm` specifies preset dataset for demonstration. In this case, it is CESM-ATM, whose dimension is 1800-by-3600, following y-x order. To otherwise specify datum file and input dimensions arbitrarily, we use `-2 3600 1800`, then it becomes

```bash
cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -2 3600 1800 -z
```
The following **essential** arguments are required,

- WORKFLOW: `-z` to compress; `-x` to decompress.
- CONFIG: `-m` to specify error control mode from `abs` (absolute) and `r2r` (relative to value range)
- CONFIG: `-e` to specify error bound
- INPUT: `-i` to specify input file
- INPUT: `-D` to specify demo dataset name or `-{1,2,3}` to dimensions
- OUTPUT: `--opath` to specify output path for both compression and decompression
- LOG: `-V` or `--verbose` to print host and device information

## lossless compression (optional)

gzip (CPU) and/or [nvcomp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvcomp) (GPU) lossless compression can be enabled in cuSZ for higher compression ratio by adding ``--gzip`` and/or ``--nvcomp``. For example,

```bash
cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -2 3600 1800 -z --gzip
cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -2 3600 1800 -z --nvcomp
cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -2 3600 1800 -z --gzip --nvcomp
```

We adopt nvcomp's Cascaded compression on GPU. We recommend its project website for more information.

## tuning by overriding
There are also internal a) quant. code representation, b) Huffman codeword representation, and c) chunk size for Huffman coding exposed. Each can be specified with argument options.

- `-Q` or `--quant-byte`  to specify quant. code representation. Options 1, 2 are for 1- and 2-byte, respectively. (Manually specifying this may not result in optimal memory footprint.)
- `-H` or `--huff-byte`  to specify Huffman codeword representation. Options 4, 8 are for 4- and 8-byte, respectively. (Manually specifying this may not result in optimal memory footprint.)
- `-C` or `--huff-chunk`  to specify chunk size for Huffman codec. This should be a sufficiently large number in power-of-2 (`[256|512|1024|...]`) and affects Huffman encoding/decoding performance *significantly*.


## enabling preprocessing
Some application such as EXAFEL preprocesses with binning [^binning] in addition to skipping Huffman codec.

[^binning]: A current binning setting is to downsample a 2-by-2 cell to 1 point.

## disabling modules
For EXAFEL, given binning and `uint8_t` have already resulted in a compression ratio of up to 16, Huffman codec may not be needed in a real-world use scenario, so Huffman codec can be skipped with `--skip huffman`.

Decompression can give a full preview of the whole workflow and writing data of the orignal size to the filesystem is long, so writing decompressed data to filesystem can be skipped with `--skip write.x`. 

A combination of modules can be `--skip huffman,write.x`.

Other module skipping for use scenarios are in development.

## use as an analytical tool

`--dry-run` or `-r` in place of `-z` and/or `-x` enables dry-run mode to get PSNR. This employs the feature of dual-quantization that the decompressed data is guaranteed the same with prequantized data.


# hands-on examples

1. 2D CESM demo, at 1e-4 relative to value range

	```bash
	# compress
	cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z
	# decompress, use the datum to compress as basename
	cusz -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x
	# decompress, and compare with the original data
	cusz -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x --origin ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH
	```
2. 2D CESM demo, specifying output path

	```bash
	mkdir data2 data3
	# output compressed data to `data2`
	cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z --opath data2
	# output decompressed data to `data3`
	cusz -i ./data2/ex-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x --opath data3
	```
3. 2D CESM demo, with 1-byte (`uint8_t`) and 256 quant. bins

	```bash
	cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -x -d 256 -Q 1
	```
4. in addition to the previous command, skipping Huffman codec,

	```bash
	cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -d 256 -Q 1 \
		--skip huffman  # or `-X huffman`
	cusz -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH.sz -x  # `-d`, `-Q`, `-X` is recorded
	```
5. some application such as EXAFEL preprocessed with binning [^binning] in addition to skipping Huffman codec

	```bash
	** cautious, may not be working as of 0.1.3
	cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -x \
		-d 256 -Q 1 --pre binning --skip huffman	# or `-p binning`
	```
6. dry-run to get PSNR and to skip real compression or decompression; `-r` also works alternatively to `--dry-run`

	```bash
	# This works equivalently to decompress with `--origin /path/to/origin-datum`
	cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/ex-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm --dry-run	# or `-r`
	```

# results
## compression ratio

To calculate compression ratio, please use *size of original data* divided by *size of .sz compressed data*.

## compression throughput

To calculate (de)compression throughput, please follow the below steps to use [`script/sh.parse-nvprof-log`](./script/parse_nvprof_log.sh):
- use `nvprof --log-file <logfile> <cusz cmd>` to generate performance log when (de)compressing
- use `./script/sh.parse-nvprof-log <logfile>` to extract kernel time performance data
- sum up all the numbers between `++++++++` to get the overall (de)compression time in us
- use the original data size divided by the (de)compression time to get the overall (de)compression throughput
- A sample output from on `CLDHGH` (25 MiB, CESM variable) is shown [here](./doc/sample-stat.txt).
- From the [sample](./doc/sample-stat.txt), the compression and decompression times are 733.47 us (w/o c/b) and 1208.19 us, respectively. So, the compression and decompression throughputs are 31.4 GB/s and 20.7 GB/s, respectively.

**Please note that cuSZ's performance might be dropped for a single large input file (e.g., in several Gigabytes) because of current coarse-grained deflating in Huffman codec mentioned in [limitations of this version](https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ#limitations-of-this-version-011).**

## sample kernel performance (compression/zip)

Throughput is in the unit of GB/s if not otherwise specified, 

|                    | dual-quant | hist  | codebook | enc. | outlier | OVERALL* | mem bw (ref) | memcpy (ref) |

(*) OVERALL kernel throughput estimation is based on leaving out 1) codebook construction, considering a prebuilt tree could be in use, 2) kernel launching overhead. A more detailed benchmark can be found at [`doc/benchmark.md`](https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ/blob/master/doc/benchmark.md).

## limitations of this version (Jan. 10, 2021)

- cuSZ only supports 4-byte `float` data type. We will support 8-byte `double` data type in the future release. 
- The current Huffman codec consists of optimal (1) histogramming [1], (2) parallel Huffman codebook building [2] of canonical code [3], and suboptimal Huffman encoding. We are woking on a faster high-throughput finer-grained Huffman codec. 
- We are working on host- and device-side API design.
- Please use `-H 8` whenever there is reported error. (The default `-H 4` may not be working for all.) We are working on adapting 4- or 8-byte representation automatically. 
- A performance degradation is expected when handling large-size dataset, e.g., 1-GB or 4-GB 1D HACC. We are working on tuning consistent performance.
- Binning preprocessing is subject to change, currently not available.
